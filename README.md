# Platoon-Tracker

Currently building a cloud-deployable web application using MERN (MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS, Node.JS) in which unit leaders can upload an
MTOE and select their applicable sections. The application builds a dashboard where
leaders can assign soldiers to slots, manage personnel information, and manage
equipment information. Leaders can keep track of information such as soldier counseling
packets, promotion dates, equipment locations, etc. When a soldier PCS or ETS, it is easy
to archive the soldier and add a new incoming soldier.
